# LearningLabyrinth

**Project Abstract**
Learning Labyrinth is an educational aid application for beginner Java programmers that
challenges them to write Java code that will enable a simulated robot to escape a simple
two-dimensional maze in as few moves as possible. The application tests the userâ€™s written
code and shows the resulting movement of the robot. All attempts of a maze are recorded with
the account_id, maze_id, and movement list.
